==================

Partial changelog reconstructed from svn commits:

 * Remove firebug (egj, rob)
 * Cleanup & documentation (novalis)
 * new oc-js-unhide behavior, for unhiding js ui on page load; use

   support since they'd see both elements. (pw)

   element (douglas)

   members and validating that they exist (douglas)
