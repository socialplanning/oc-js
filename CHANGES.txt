0.7 (2009-11-05)
================

 * added jquery 1.3.2 so we can maybe start transitioning to it, or at
   least make one-off pages that use it.  For now, it's recommended to
   only use it on pages that need it to reduce overhead.  (pw)

 * no longer register oc-js resource directory; these javascripts have
   recently moved back into opencore where their versions can be more
   easily kept in sync with opencore. they will be removed from this 
   package soon. (egj)

==================

Partial changelog reconstructed from svn commits:

 * Remove firebug (egj, rob)
 * Cleanup & documentation (novalis)
 * new oc-js-unhide behavior, for unhiding js ui on page load; use
   this alongside a noscript tag for degradation.  Doug has doubts
   whether this plays nicely with clients that lack both JS and CSS
   support since they'd see both elements. (pw)
 * Fix a bug in breathelife preventing multiple behaviors on a single
   element (douglas)
 * Add new MemberList behavior for dynamically building a list of
   members and validating that they exist (douglas)
 * In-progress work on google maps stuff (not used in any opencore
