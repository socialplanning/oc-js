0.8 (2010-11-28)
================

 * added thirdparty/xinha97-pre directory, imported from http://svn.xinha.org/trunk
   at r1296.  opencore itself will register the resource directory, and
   will provide its own xinha configuration file.

0.7 (2009-11-05)
================

 * added jquery 1.3.2 so we can maybe start transitioning to it, or at
   least make one-off pages that use it.  For now, it's recommended to
   only use it on pages that need it to reduce overhead.  (pw)

 * no longer register oc-js resource directory; these javascripts have
   recently moved back into opencore where their versions can be more
   easily kept in sync with opencore. they will be removed from this 
   package soon. (egj)

0.6.4 (2009-05-07)
==================

 * suppress alert confirmations when pressing the clear word button (rmarianski)

0.6.3 (2009-05-06)
==================

 * add word clean button to toolbar (rmarianski)

 * call clear fonts when cleaning word as well (rmarianski)

=========================
*** Needs filling out ***
=========================

0.6.0 (2008-07-22)
==================

 * add js to inline the add wiki page form when clicking on the link
   (rmarianski)

 * Added oc-js-static-map class to mark a map as non-draggable.
   (egj)

 * Use 'geolocation' form field instead of 'position-text'.
   'location' will just be used for human-readable description. (egj, pw)

 * Fixed http://trac.openplans.org/livablestreets/ticket/169
   Copy tabIndex property so that IE users will properly tab through (douglas)

   'password' hint (douglas)

Partial changelog reconstructed from svn commits:

0.4.1 (2008-01-10)
==================

Partial changelog reconstructed from svn commits:

 * Remove firebug (egj, rob)
 * Cleanup & documentation (novalis)
 * new oc-js-unhide behavior, for unhiding js ui on page load; use
   this alongside a noscript tag for degradation.  Doug has doubts
   whether this plays nicely with clients that lack both JS and CSS
   support since they'd see both elements. (pw)
 * Fix a bug in breathelife preventing multiple behaviors on a single
   element (douglas)
 * Add new MemberList behavior for dynamically building a list of
   members and validating that they exist (douglas)
 * In-progress work on google maps stuff (not used in any opencore
   release yet) (pw, douglas)
